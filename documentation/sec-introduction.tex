\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Thanks}
	I first created \texttt{latexindent.pl} to help me format chapter files in a big project.
	After I blogged about it on the \TeX{} stack exchange \cite{cmhblog} I received some
	positive feedback and follow-up feature requests. A big thank you to Harish Kumar
	\cite{harish} who helped to develop and test the initial versions of the script.

	The \texttt{YAML}-based interface of \texttt{latexindent.pl} was inspired by the
	wonderful \texttt{arara} tool; any similarities are deliberate, and I hope that it is
	perceived as the compliment that it is. Thank you to Paulo Cereda and the team for
	releasing this awesome tool; I initially worried that I was going to have to make a GUI
	for \texttt{latexindent.pl}, but the release of \texttt{arara} has meant there is no
	need.

	There have been several contributors to the project so far (and hopefully more in the
	future!); thank you very much to the people detailed in \vref{sec:contributors} for their
	valued contributions, and thank you to those who report bugs and request features at
	\cite{latexindent-home}.
